## My process

### Built with

- Tailwind CSS
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Tailwind CSS - Utility First Classes

```html
<div
  className="flex lg:w-5/6 flex-col xl:flex-row justify-around xl:justify-evenly xl:items-center h-full px-4 xl:px-12 xl:py-8"
>
  <HeroText />
  <HeroImage />
</div>
```

```css
.flex {flex-col items-center justify-around xl:max-w-full md:max-w-4xl max-w-md h-full bg-primary-verypalecyan}
```

```js
const [width, setWidth] = React.useState(window.innerWidth);
const breakPoint = 1440;
useEffect(() => {
  const handleWindowResize = () => setWidth(window.innerWidth);
  window.addEventListener('resize', handleWindowResize);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handleWindowResize);
}, []);
```

### Continued development

Tailwind CSS and its Utility Class also making layouts using grids and flexbox

### Useful resources

- [Animejs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-anime) - This helped me for Spring Animation on Load. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
